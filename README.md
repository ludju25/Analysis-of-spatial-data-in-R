Faculty project in "Applied Statistics" aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of the R programming language for displaying and analyzing spatial data.

The project showcased how to retrieve various types of world maps and how to process and display the obtained data according to specific preferences and needs.

Some examples of maps/data presented in this project include: population density of continents, average age of the population in different parts of the world, identification and marking of regions where life expectancy exceeds a certain age, geographical elevation differences of specific continents and countries, distinguishing river flows from other parts of the map, etc.

In addition to simple static maps, the project also demonstrated how animated maps can be created in R to display certain geodemographic changes over time.

Within the code/documentation theoretical explanations of certain concepts and code sections, as well as lines of code for installing the necessary packages are written as comments. The entire code and documentation are written in Croatian since they were created for academic purposes, but the code is clearly organized and readable, making translation and adaptation to other languages easier.

I hope this will be helpful to someone :)
